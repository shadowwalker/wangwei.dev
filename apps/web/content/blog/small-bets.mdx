## The myth of the big launch

I used to think success came from big swings. The perfect product launch. The viral post. The breakthrough moment.

But that's not how it works. Most overnight successes are years in the making—just invisible until they're not.

## The small bets philosophy

Instead of betting everything on one outcome, I've learned to make many small bets:

- Write one post, see what resonates
- Build one feature, see who uses it
- Make one connection, see where it leads

Each bet teaches you something. Over time, the winners compound.

## Showing up consistently

The secret ingredient isn't talent or luck. It's consistency.

When you show up every day (or every week, or every month), you:
- Build skills through repetition
- Create more opportunities for luck to find you
- Develop a body of work that speaks for itself

## What this looks like in practice

For me, it means:

- Writing regularly, even when I don't feel inspired
- Shipping small updates instead of waiting for perfection
- Sharing work publicly, even when it's uncomfortable
- Following up on connections, even when it feels awkward

None of these feel like big moves. But they add up.

## The long game

Building something meaningful takes time. The compound effect only works if you stay in the game.

So I'm not trying to win tomorrow. I'm trying to still be here, still building, still learning—next year and the year after that.

The small bets will add up. They always do.
