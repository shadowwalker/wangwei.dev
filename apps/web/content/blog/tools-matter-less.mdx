## The setup rabbit hole

Every few months, I fall into the same trap. I convince myself that if I just had the right tools, the right setup, the right workflow—everything would click. I'd be more productive. More creative. More effective.

So I spend hours researching. Comparing. Configuring. And at the end of it all, I've made almost no progress on the actual work.

## The tools I actually use

For what it's worth, here's my current stack:

- **Editor**: VS Code with minimal extensions
- **Terminal**: Warp (but iTerm worked fine for years)
- **Notes**: Obsidian for thinking, Notion for sharing
- **Design**: Figma
- **Code**: TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind

But here's the thing: I could do my work with almost any reasonable alternative. The tools are not the bottleneck.

## What actually matters

The bottleneck is usually:

1. **Clarity of thought** - Knowing what to build
2. **Consistent execution** - Actually doing the work
3. **Feedback loops** - Learning from what you ship

No tool can give you these. They come from practice, from showing up, from shipping even when it's not perfect.

## The permission to stop optimizing

If you're reading this while procrastinating on actual work, here's your permission slip: Your current tools are good enough. Go build something.

The best setup is the one you use to ship.
