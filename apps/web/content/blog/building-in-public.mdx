## The fear of being seen

There's something terrifying about sharing work before it's done. We want to present our best selves, our polished outcomes, our success stories. But the messy middle—the part where we're figuring things out—that's what we hide.

I used to be the same way. I'd work on projects in secret, only revealing them when they were "ready." But I've learned that ready is a myth. Nothing is ever truly ready.

## Why building in public works

When you build in public, you get feedback faster. You attract people who care about what you're building. You create accountability for yourself.

But more than that, you become part of a community. People root for you. They offer help. They share their own struggles. The isolation of solo building transforms into something collaborative.

## The unexpected benefit

The biggest surprise? Vulnerability creates connection. When I share my failures alongside my wins, people relate. They see themselves in my struggles. And that creates trust.

Building in public isn't about marketing or growth hacks. It's about being human in a space that often feels sterile and performative.

## Getting started

If you're thinking about building in public, start small:

1. Share a problem you're trying to solve
2. Post an update when you make progress
3. Be honest when things don't work

You don't need an audience to start. The practice itself changes how you think about your work.
